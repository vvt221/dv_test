# Data Visualization Final 2019

## Team Member : Vaidehi Thete (vvt221)

## Tasks Chosen:

2. For those trips that could not be served, do they follow a spatial or temporal pattern? For example,
are most of those trips originated in particular regions, and of certain times?

4. We also limit vehicle capacity to at most 4 passengers. Were there vehicles violating this condition? If
so, can you show any pattern about these vehicles? For example, how many of them were violating,
and where were they distributed in both time and space?

#### Explanation:
From the plot it can be seen that a majority of the trips are not served in the early hours of the morning from 12.00 AM to 4.00 AM. However, this trend suddenly drops between 5.00 AM and 11.00 AM . This could be because this is the time duration around which people commute to their workplaces and they cannot afford to be late which is why the number of trips where the rides are dropped is low. There is once again an increase in the number of trips dropped. However there is a sharp decline in the number of trips dropped at 9.00 pm ,which could be due to people wanting to reach home as early as possible. The high percentage of ride dropping during the hours discussed above could be due to the high price being charged during these hours but data is not available to verify that.

This plot shows the bar charts based on the counts of the Actual_Pickup station where most rides could not be served. The counts are then sorted in decreasing order of their frequency. Station ID 229 and Station ID 1196 hold the record for having the highest number of dropped records. Further exploration is done in the spatial plot below:
